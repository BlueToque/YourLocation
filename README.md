YourLocation
============

YourLo.ca/tion is a service that allows Search and Rescue agencies to use a lost person's smart phone to find their location.
It has some limitations; it needs a good cellular and GPS signal, and access to the internet to transmit the position
back to the requesting agency.

This code constitutes the prototype service I wrote over a few days in March, 2013, proving the concept. The entire service is 
written in Javascript, HTML5 and uses the geolocation API.

I made use of Google Spreasheetts to record the requests and the responses. A script embedded in one of those spreadhseets sends 
email. Other than the Google Spreadsheets, the code you see here is entriely Javascript and HTML
